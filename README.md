## Predicting Diabetes and Investigating Factors Associated with Diabetes Risk using Classification Models

The following application provides users insights into factors associated with diabetes risk and compares classification models' effectiveness in predicting diabetes. Users can enter their health information to make a prediction using our pre trained models. They also can train their own models to gain an understanding behind the various machine learning models.

Our application consists of the following pages:
-Explore Data (Data Exploration and Visualizations)
-Explore Results (Evaluation of our trained models)
-Model Exploration (Users can train their models here and evaluate them)
-Predict Diabetes Risk (Users can predict diabetes state using our pre trained models)

To run the application, you will require the following packages: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, plotly, streamlit, matplotlib, imblearn, pickle, seaborn, os, random, PIL
